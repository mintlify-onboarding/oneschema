title: "Configuring File Upload URL"
---

With this import configuration, the cleaned file will be sent to an URL you provide for each importer session. This can for example be a presigned S3 upload URL. To use this import method, specify `importConfig: { type: "file-upload", url: "<upload-url>"}` in your configuration for OneSchema. 

This supports sending the data as a CSV or JSON file.

The file data will be sent in the body of a single PUT request to the provided URL. Headers for the PUT request may be optionally set via the [FileUploadImportConfig _headers_ parameter](/docs/javascript#headers).

When an import completes _and_ the file has been successfully deposited in the signed URL, the [success event](/docs/javascript#success-event) will be fired which will include the `embed_id`. If an error occurs, an error message will be displayed and the [error event](/docs/javascript#error-event) will be fired. 

#### Presigned S3 Upload URL Requirements

The presigned URL has to be created by someone who has permission to create files in the S3 bucket. Make sure to use AWS Signature Version 4.

Besides the `bucket` and `key` parameters you also have to set the `content-type` in the parameters when creating the presigned URL. In the case of a CSV file, it should be set to `text/csv`, and in the case of a JSON file to `application/json`. If this is not set correctly the upload request will fail with a 403 status code.

Additionally, the [FileUploadImportConfig _format_ parameter](/docs/javascript#format) must be set to "json" or "csv". 

Since you provide the URL when initializing the importer make sure the URL has a long enough expiration duration to give your user enough time to go through the import workflow.
