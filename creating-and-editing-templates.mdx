At OneSchema, we refer to a set of import rules for a given sheet as a _Template_.

## Creating a template

To get to your [templates](/docs/templates), go to your OneSchema portal and select _Templates_ from the menu bar at the top of the page. An example _Contacts_ template is provided.

The steps for creating a template are as follows:

- Create a new template and add the relevant columns + their rules
- Rename the template and template key
- [Push changes](/v2/docs/creating-and-editing-templates) to the template

### Manually

In the upper right hand corner of the templates page, select _New template_, then click _Build a template from scratch_ in the window that pops up. A blank template will be created and columns can be added one by one.

### From a clean spreadsheet

In the upper right hand corner of the templates page, select _New template_, then upload a pre-cleaned spreadsheet file in the window that pops up. The clean spreadsheet file should contain headers (must be first row) and clean sample data in the format your application can accept. OneSchema will intelligently scan the data in order to automatically determine the headers and datatypes.

## Editing a template

To edit a template, click on _Details_ of the template you want to edit. Prior to changes taking effect, they must be [pushed](/v2/docs/creating-and-editing-templates).

### Adding a column

To add a new column, click _Add a column_ in the top right of a specific template's page or at the bottom of the existing columns.

### Editing an existing column

To edit a column that already exists in a template, simply click on the pencil icon associated with that column. A column can be removed by clicking on the trash can on that column's row.

### Pushing changes

After changes are made to a template, they must be pushed to the appropriate environment(s). The blue _Push Changes_ button can be found in the upper right hand corner of the page. Select the appropriate enviroment(s) and click push. If _Production_ is selected, an additional confirmation prompt will appear.

A changelog for pushes is provided to the right of the _Push changes_ button (icon: clock inside a counterclockwise arrow).

### Row Constraints

Settings for _Row constraints_ can be found in the upper right corner of a template's page, just to the left of the _Add a column_ button. A row constraint is a conditional check of one column's value based on the value contained in another. Each row is checked individually. For a given row, the check follows the form of: If column A contains X, then column B must contain Y, else surface an error.

### Validation webhooks

A validation webhook is a way to validate data against a third-party data source, your database, or perform complex formulaic checks. OneSchema will pass the requested data via webhook to an endpoint you host, and simply expects to receive a list of errors and warnings in response. Please see our [validation webhook API documentation](/docs/validation-webhook).

A validation webhook is created for a specific template and associated to a template by clicking _Add validation hook_ on the left-hand sidebar.

| Field                  | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validation hook name\* | A name so you can easily identify your webhook.                                                |
| URL\*                  | The URL of your endpoint.                                                                      |
| Template column keys\* | Select the columns you'd like passed to your endpoint. Only the selected columns will be sent. |
| Secret key             | Optional, a way to ensure the call is authorized.                                              |
| \* = Required          |                                                                                                |
