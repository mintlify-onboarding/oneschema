#### Overview

A spreadsheet is a document in which data is arranged in rows (horizontal) and columns (vertical) to form a grid. Spreadsheets have a header row (usually the top row) in which each cell serves as a description for the data in its corresponding column. Following the header row, are rows of data. Each piece of data in a row is contained within its own cell which corresponds to, and is positioned below, the relevant header.

#### Processable formats

In order for a spreadsheet to be processed by OneSchema, it must follow the format of 2D-tabular data. This means that, header row withstanding, data in a given column must be in a consistent and identical format. Any data in a column that does not conform to the specified [validation](/docs/validations) format, will trigger an error.

#### File formats

Spreadsheets come in different file formats depending on the program used to generate them. The most common file formats are .csv (comma-separated values) and .xlsx (Excel files) which are the formats OneSchema accepts.

OneSchema can upload Excel Workbooks in .xlsx format, and will import one sheet at a time as specified by the user.

#### Examples

##### Processable

The spreadsheet below is processable since the data is consistent row by row.

##### Not processable

The spreadsheet below is not in 2D-tabular format due to the "_Contacted"_ \+ _"Not Contacted"_ rows. It cannot be processed by OneSchema due to the inconsistency of the data row by row.
