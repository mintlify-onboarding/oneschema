#### Overview

A validation is a pre-determined rule to which data must conform. It determines how data should be cleaned. Validations are applied to data to ensure the data meets specific requirements (business logic). A validation passes when the data complies with the rule, and fails when the data is in a form that is not acceptable. 

Each cell in a column with a validation will be checked individually against the specified rules.

#### Native validations

OneSchema has a library of [native data validations](/docs/validation-types). These are no-code validations that can be applied with as little as one click. Examples include _Number_ to ensure the data imported only contains numbers and _Email_ which checks a string for valid email syntax.

A list of OneSchemas data validation library can be found [here](/reference/template-resource#validation-types).

#### Validation Webhook

A validation webhook is a way to use an API endpoint to create a custom validator. OneSchema will pass data to a specified endpoint, and it can be validated against a database, a third party data source, or complex logic checks can be performed. OneSchema simply expects a response of errors and warnings.

See our API [documentation on Validation Webhooks here](/docs/validation-webhook).

#### Example

##### Number

A number validator specifies that the data contained in each cell of a column must be an integer between -5 and 24\. The validator does not allow commas.

See the following data...

| Data | Result                    |
| ---- | ------------------------- |
| 6    | Pass                      |
| 3.7  | Fail, non-integer         |
| \-6  | Fail, out of range        |
| qw   | Fail, not a number        |
| 7,5  | Fail, comma not permitted |

##### Email

An email validator ensures that each string is in valid email format. 

See the following data...
