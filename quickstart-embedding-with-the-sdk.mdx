This guide will help you embed an importer in your application using a provided code-snippet. 

## Generate a Code Snippet

1. From the main Dashboard, navigate to _Code Snippet_ under the `Developers` section in the left sidebar.

1. Ensure that the _Development_ environment is selected in "Step 1".
2. Select the template you'd like to use in "Step 2".
3. Click _Generate Snippet_ in the bottom right corner.

Note: a JWT is auto-generated for you in "Step 3". More on this later. 

## Using the code snippet

* Note the tabs for `React`, `Javascript`, and `Angular` and select your desired language.
* If relevant, install the package using NPM.
* Paste the code snippet into your application and click the provided button to launch the OneSchema Embedded Importer.

## Using Other OneSchema Environments

By default the development environment allows OneSchema to be embedded on any page. Other environments like Staging and Production require an _Allowed Domains_ list, essentially a "whitelist" of where OneSchema can be embedded.

Click _Add a domain_ to set up your domain(s) list. Note that OneSchema assumes `https://` so `http://` needs to be specified when appropriate.
