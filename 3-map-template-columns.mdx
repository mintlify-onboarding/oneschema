#### Overview

On the _Map Columns_ pane, users are prompted to map their uploaded columns to the template columns you set up. If our system detects an exact text match between the two columns, we will automatically map them for the user. 

If there are any columns that don't contain any data, our system will automatically detect them and will by default, skip those columns from being imported.
