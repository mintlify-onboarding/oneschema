A [custom column](/docs/types-of-columns#custom-columns) is a column of a specified data type for which a fixed header is not pre-defined in the [template](/docs/templates). 

This is useful when you expect an unknown number of columns of the specified data type. E.g. for a given custom column of data type _Number_, the uploaded spreadsheet may include columns _Inventory quantity_, _Days since last shipment_, _Number of shipment destinations_ which will all be mapped to data type _Number_.

To add a custom column type, open your template, go to "Custom columns" in the left menu, and click "Add a custom column type":

## Example Use Case

When uploading a contacts sheet, _Meeting Date 1_, _Meeting Date 2_, and _Meeting Date 3_ are examples of columns that need date formatting but were not planned for in the template ahead of time. These columns will show up as `Unmapped` during the mapping step of the import:

Let's create a new custom column to accommodate those:

Once the changes are pushed to Production, the end-users will be able to map _Meeting Date 1_, _Meeting Date 2_, and _Meeting Date 3_ to custom column `Meeting Date` (it shows up in the UI as `Data type`):

## How It Looks In JSON

When you receive the validated data via JSON, a custom column is denoted in the `columns` array with the field `is_custom: true`. The values of a custom column are included as an object in a key called `$custom`.

For instance, a JSON you receive from OneSchema may look something like this:

JSON

`{
  "webhook_key": "primary",
  "template_key": "contacts",
	...
  "columns": [
    {
      "sheet_column_name": "First Name",
      "template_column_name": "First name",
      "template_column_key": "first_name"
    },
    {
      "sheet_column_name": "Last Name",
      "template_column_name": "Last Name",
      "template_column_key": "last_name"
    },
    {
      "sheet_column_name": "Email",
      "template_column_name": "email",
      "template_column_key": "email"
    },
    {
      "sheet_column_name": "Priority",
      "template_column_name": "Tier",
      "template_column_key": "tier",
      "is_custom": true,
      "custom_column_name": "Priority"
    }
  ],
  "sequence_number": 1,
  "sequence_count": 1,
  "data": {
    "count": 228,
    "records": [
      {
        "last_name": "Goel",
        "$custom": {
          "3": "HIGH"
        },
        "first_name": "Aditi",
        "email": "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)"
      }
      ...
    ],
    "error_records": [
      {
        "data": {
          "$custom": {
            "3": "LOW"
          },
          "first_name": "Jack",
          "last_name": "Mattson",
          "email": "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)"
        },
        "errors": {
          "email": [
            13
          ],
          "$custom": {
            "3": [
              1
            ]
          }
        }
      }
      ...
    ]
  }
}
`

In this example, "priority" is a custom column. It is the fourth column in the `columns` Array, so its index is 3\. The name given to this column by the user will be in the `custom_column_name` field of this column in the columns array.
