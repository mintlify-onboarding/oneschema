Please see the following tables for OneSchema performance benchmarks. Updated September, 2022\. 

## Upload speed

Time for file to be uploaded, parsed, and intelligently map column headers for the user to confirm.

| Number of rows | Time                |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 1k             | 1.3 seconds         |
| 10k            | 1.8 seconds         |
| 100k           | 8.8 seconds         |
| 1M             | 17.5 seconds        |
| 10M            | 1 minute 47 seconds |

## Validation speed

Validation speed is the time it takes to go through the different validations for all mapped columns across the entire file. In this case, the tested validations were across two proper case fields (first name, last name), email, date, and address fields.

| Number of rows | Time        |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| 1k             | 1 second    |
| 10k            | 1.1 seconds |
| 100k           | 1.2 seconds |
| 1M             | 3.2 seconds |
| 10M            | 5.6 seconds |

## Transformation speed

Transform speed is the time required to automatically fix all errors detected in the test file using OneSchema native transformations

| Number of rows | Time         |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| 1k             | 0.6 seconds  |
| 10k            | 1 second     |
| 100k           | 1.3 seconds  |
| 1M             | 3.8 seconds  |
| 10M            | 22.5 seconds |
