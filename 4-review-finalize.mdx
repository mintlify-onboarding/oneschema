#### Overview

The _Review & Finalize_ pane is where we expect users to spend majority of their time in this flow. Your users will be presented with a spreadsheet-like experience where they can leverage our system to automatically fix validation errors within their file, or they can manually edit any cells directly. Once they are satisfied with their file, they can import their data. The finalized data will be passed to your backend via the [selected import method](/docs/importing-validated-data).
